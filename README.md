Hi all! welcome to SQLBananza where you can go shopping, be a manager or superviser.

To get started, creat a .env with :
DB_HOST=
DB_USER=
DB_PASS=
DB_PORT=
DB_NAME=

Next launch custom.js in command prompt. npm install dotenv, inquirer, mysql, console.table

After that you can select customer, manager, superviser, or exit.
Each user has there own functionality.

Have fun!
